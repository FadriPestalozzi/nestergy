# Nestergy

Want to supply your home with renewable electricity and heat?

Nestergy helps you take an informed decision based on:

- your location,
- your budget, and
- the expanding sea of technological possibilities available right now.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The initial goal of Nestergy is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that
provides core functionality to help users evaluate renewable energy options at
their location. The MVP will include:

### Location-Based Recommendations:

Input your location to get tailored suggestions for renewable energy solutions
(e.g., solar, wind, geothermal) suitable for your area.

### Budget Calculator:

Enter your budget to see which technologies fit your financial constraints.

### Technology Overview:

A simple list of available renewable energy technologies with basic pros and
cons.

The MVP will focus on a user-friendly interface and essential features to
validate the concept and gather user feedback.

## Ideas to Extend and Grow Functionality Once MVP is established

Nestergy can be expanded with the following features to enhance its
capabilities:

### Advanced Cost Estimation:

Integrate detailed cost breakdowns, including installation, maintenance, and
potential government subsidies or tax incentives for renewable energy adoption.

### Energy Savings Simulator:

Add a tool to simulate long-term energy savings and return on investment (ROI)
based on the chosen technology and local energy prices.

### Weather and Climate Integration:

Incorporate real-time weather data and climate patterns to provide more accurate
recommendations (e.g., solar panel efficiency based on sunlight hours in your
area).

### Vendor Comparison:

Partner with renewable energy vendors to allow users to compare quotes and
services directly within the platform.

### Carbon Footprint Tracker:

Add a feature to calculate and track the reduction in carbon footprint achieved
by switching to renewable energy solutions.

### Community Features:

Introduce a community section where users can share experiences, tips, and
success stories about their renewable energy setups.

### Mobile App Development:

Create a mobile app version of Nestergy for on-the-go access to recommendations
and tools.

### AI-Powered Insights:

Implement machine learning to provide personalized recommendations based on user
behavior, local regulations, and emerging technologies.

# üê£ Easter Egg: Hatching "Nestergy"

<details>
<summary>Curious about how Nestergy got its name? Click to find out! üåü</summary>

- Nestergy was born in Barcelona on the sunny Thursday morning of May 22, 2025.
- At 08:22 AM CEST, the mutual prompts between a human and a machine to explore
  ways of expressing a cozy, warm home, embraced by the pulsating power of
  renewable energy, culminated in the name "Nestergy".
- The machine, aka one of the many incarnations of
  [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), started off with
  the human requirements, combining and re-combining them in impossible ways.
- EnerSpec.AI felt too cold.
- EnerNest already included the warmth of a "nest"
- Wanting to hint at heat, electricity, and synergy, we continued playing with
  names like LumaNest, ThermaNest, and VoltNest
- ... until we hatched-out Nestergy ‚Äî a perfect blend of _nest_ (for warmth),
  _synergy_ (for combining heat and power), and _energy_ (for renewable
  solutions).
- It‚Äôs memorable, emotionally resonant, and tech-forward
- a name that captures the heart and innovation of this project ü¶æü´Äüêç
